## Zoho CRM Widget Boilerplate using React, Vite, and Tailwind

This boilerplate provides a starting point for building Zoho CRM widgets using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It simplifies the development process by offering pre-configured tools and functionalities.

### Features

* **React for Building UI:** Leverage React's component-based architecture to create interactive and dynamic widget interfaces.
* **Vite for Blazing-Fast Development:** Enjoy a smooth and efficient development experience with Vite's fast build times and hot module replacement (HMR).
* **Tailwind CSS for Rapid Styling:** Utilize Tailwind's utility-first approach to style your widget components quickly and efficiently.
* **Automatic Zip Creation:** The boilerplate automatically generates a zip file compatible for uploading to Zoho CRM.
* **Standard Vite Commands:** Use the familiar `vite` commands for development (`dev`), build (`build`), and preview (`preview`).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zoho-widget-react-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd zoho-widget-react-boilerplate
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. **Development:**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch your widget in a browser window and enable HMR for instant updates reflected upon code changes.

2. **Building:**

   Create an optimized production build for uploading to Zoho CRM:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate a zip file in the project's root directory, containing all necessary files for your widget.

3. **Linting:**

   Maintain code quality:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   This command runs ESLint to check for potential errors and style inconsistencies in your code.

4. **Preview (Optional):**

   (Requires additional configuration)

   Vite offers a preview server for a more realistic development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   Follow the instructions provided in the terminal output to access the preview server.

### Uploading to Zoho CRM
